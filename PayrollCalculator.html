    Web Scripting
    Assignment 3.2

      This is an HTML file that utilizes a javascript within the page to perform calculations. First, the webpage prompts
    the user to enter the number of hours worked by an employee using an HTML form tag. Second, using a script tag, the
    webpage accesses the form and assigns it to variable x. Thrid, the script accesses the value of the name element within
    script and assigns it to variable y. Fourth, a boolean is used to determine if the user entered value is greater than
    or less than or equal to 40 hours. Finally, the script displays an alert window with the proper text information. -->
