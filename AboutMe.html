    Web Scripting
    Assignment 1.2

      This is a simple HTML About page that links back to the index page, displays some information about me, and links to 3 of my favorite websites.
    First, the a href tag links the AboutMe page back to the Index page. Second, the h1 tag creates a header and displays About the author to the user.
    Third, a paragraph tag is used to display some personal information about me. Fourth, the h3 tag is used to create a header that is smaller than the
    header that uses the h1 tag. Finally, an unordered list is created with 3 hyperlinks to my favorite websites.-->

      My name is Corey Hicks, and I've wanted to be a programmer since my family bought their first computer. I've also been serving in the Army Reserves for the last 7 years. After returning from Iraq in 2016, I took the plunge and started working for a software
      development company while buckling down my college career. Since this course is all about web scripting, let's take a look at some of my favorite websites!

      <!--opening tag for unordered list-->
      <li><a href="https://www.kongregate.com">Kongregate</a></li>
      <!--list of 3 hyperlinks with the title of the website displayed to the user-->
      <li><a href="https://www.newgrounds.com">Newgrounds</a></li>
